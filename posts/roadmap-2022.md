Each year I find myself starting new projects, pushing my first weeks worth of commits to Git and then forgetting about it for 6 months.

I feel semi determined to make this year a bit different. I have ticked one project off which was getting this portfolio published. I was eyeballing NextJS for a while and decided I would go for it.

This year I want to deep dive into some heavy data projects. I would love to build a Lego querying database and perhaps hook it in to [Amazon](https://amazon.com/) so you can search kits and find them on Amazon. I have also been looking at [TripAdvisor API](https://www.tripadvisor.com/developers). I have been planning a working holiday to Europe and am wondering how far I can get in a weekend. I would like to tap into the Travel and Tourism experience I have and build an application where you can build a radius around a given location by travel time, and have the map pin attractions and points of interest.

Obviously, all of this requires a bit of help to support. I intend to build my own [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) environment for CI/CD pipelines in AWS - this will enable me to automate my deployments and achieve a better time to market.

So far I have just been word vomiting things I would like to do this year. There is a little rhyme and reason to this though and by tackling these projects along with updating my own portfolio I hope to achieve the following outcomes:

- Jenkins - Developing infrastructure and DevOps skills
- Lego Cataloging - Dive into NextJS and develop a solid full stack application that can handle a lot of data
- Destination Tracker - Utilise a third party tool and use skills to actually deliver a good user experience
- Enhance this Portfolio - I would like to add features to this portfolio, connect to the global software community and hopefully help as many people as I can!

This is my first article on this site and I hope you like it! I am trialling a lot of things here and the objective is definitely not to be agile here. I will be building everything custom to get some good practice in and build features such as commenting, newsletters and maybe even user accounts and competitions down the track. Once I have a way to communicate with users I hope to see some suggestions from anyone who is taking the time to read this!

Cheers!
