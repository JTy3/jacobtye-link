Stumbling back across my post for all I wanted to do in 2023 and I am feeling a little disheartened. I only got some serious ground on 1 of the 4 projects I discussed in my last blog. However as I sit and think on the year that has been I realise that whilst I didn't quite follow the plan; who on earth does?

Rather than spending time and energy on pondering on what I could of done different I think it is better spent reflecting on how great the year was; redefining my goals and scope; and going at it all over again.

Whilst I didn't build my destination tracker - or build all the functions I wanted to this blog - I consider myself reasonably decorated in great achievements and experiences.

Since I last left off I have travelled Europe for two months, exploring the Austrian Alps and Northern Italy; driving through Germany and spending some amazing nights in Paris and Amsterdam followed by a flight to Florence where I wandered around Cinque Terre; Pisa and Rome. I swam in the waters of Capri - hopped along the Amalfi before flying to the UK and having a long overdue week of family time and connection with my extended family.

I returned to Australia with a new view of the world and decided to switch up my career a bit and now I have taken a position in a startup company in an entirely new industry with new challenges, new people and a new environment.

My travels also gave me the confidence to get up and move states and I am now enjoying sunny QLD as I still work remotely.

Cheers!
Jacob
